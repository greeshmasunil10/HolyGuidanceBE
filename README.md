# Holy Guidance (Back-End)

Holy Guidance is an app that provides Bible-based advice and verses for your personal struggles. Using OpenAI's powerful language processing capabilities, Holy Guidance analyzes your input and generates meaningful responses that are rooted in biblical teachings.

With Holy Guidance, you can be sure that the advice and guidance you receive are not only personalized, but also rooted in the timeless wisdom of the Bible. Try it out today and see how it can help you navigate life's challenges.

## Getting Started

To use the application, simply go to the [Holy Guidance website](http://holy-guidance-fe.herokuapp.com/).
Enter your problem or worry into the text box and press "Ask Bible Buddy." The chatbot will respond with a Bible-based advice related to your issue.

## How It Works

Holy Guidance uses OpenAI to generate Bible-based advice. 

When you submit an issue or a question, the app's frontend sends a request to the Flask backend, which in turn creates a customized request to the OpenAI API. OpenAI then processes the request and generates a personalized response that includes Bible-based advice and verses that are relevant to your specific situation.
